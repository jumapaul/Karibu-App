### Karibu App
#### Problem statement
We all have been in  situation where you go to a restaurant and have  to wait for sometimes for you to be attended to. Or, you enter into a restaurant and you hve to look at the menu to see what is available, the price and make order. This also will take some times to be served. Basically this result to time wastage or leads to a rush especially when there is a meeting or an important occassion to attend to. This is where the karibu app comes into action.
Imagine a situation where you could choose the closest restaurant near you, make orders and payment online. This works such that when you arrive at your choosen restaurant, you get your table ready with the meals that you ordered for. This results into conserving time since you get in, eat and leave. No more waiting at the table when you are in there. Seems interesting right?

#### Target customers
The target here is to save the little time that the customer has. This means it really convenient for the customer with a very limited time. This is for example, the office workers during the breaks. And, the customers at a rush to attend to something.
This does not mean that there is an exclusion, no. You can book a restaurant for parties, dinners, etc. The big deal is that when you arrive at our restaurants, everything is obsolutely ready.
